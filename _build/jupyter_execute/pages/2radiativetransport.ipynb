In this image, the tree to the left corresponds to an optical depth of approximately 1, since it is mostly obscured, though still visible. The person in the foreground is at an optical depth of less than 1 (perhaps around 0.5), since they are easily discernable and there is very little fog blocking light between the person and the observer.
