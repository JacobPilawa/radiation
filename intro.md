# Introduction

Lecture notes and material for Radiative Processes in Astrophysics from UC Berkeley. Put together by Jacob Pilawa to study for preliminary exam.

## Course Description

```{admonition} From [Astrobaki](https://casper.astro.berkeley.edu/astrobaki/index.php/Radiative_Processes_in_Astrophysics):

An introduction to the basic physics of astronomy and astrophysics at the graduate level. Principles of energy transfer by radiation. Elements of classical and quantum theory of photon emission; bremsstrahlung, synchrotron radiation. Compton scattering, plasma effects, atomic and molecular electromagnetic transitions. With applications to current research into astrophysical phenomena.

These are a collection of lectures covering topics in an introductory graduate astrophysics course on radiative processes. The subject matter is loosely drawn from [Radiative Processes in Astrophysics](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981PEPI...25..432L) by Rybicki & Lightman.
